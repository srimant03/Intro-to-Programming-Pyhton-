# Intro-to-Programming-Pyhton

These are a few basic programming tasks in python and codes that I wrote in the first few weeks of learning how to code. These are not only specific to python but helpful while learning programming in general like matrix operations, basic math operations, oops etc. It includes the following:-

1) Basic math related codes
2) File I/O related tasks
3) Codes to familiarise yourself with matrix operations
4) Oops in Python
